# Submit for TestFlight Review

This tool is meant to submit builds that are already uploaded to TestFlight for [Beta App Reviews](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/prerelease_versions_and_beta_testers/beta_app_review_submissions). This tool uses the [AppStoreConnect API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi) and authenticate through [API keys](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/creating_api_keys_for_app_store_connect_api), so it should be compatible with all runners.
